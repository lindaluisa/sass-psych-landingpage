                                    Many of us go through life without understanding the origins of painful feelings or troubling behaviors. This can play a part in leading to relational problems, other life disruptions, and even anxiety or depression. Often we find ourselves alone with our pain. For most people, sharing our stories with a trusted person is a healing experience.

                                    When we understand ourselves better we can begin to see things differently and more accurately. This allows us to make healthier choices for ourselves.
